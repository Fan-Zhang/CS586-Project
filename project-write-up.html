<h3 id="how-the-database-was-populated">How the database was populated</h3>
<p>The dataset used can be found at <a href="http://www.dunnhumby.com/sourcefiles">dunnhumby</a>, under the &quot;The Complete Journey&quot; section. The zip file contains 8 CSV files. This project used four of them: causal_data.csv, hh_demographic.csv, product,csv and transaction_data.csv. Here's the process to prepare the data to load into tables, done with a Linux shell and common Linux tools:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Make sure simple split by comma works (observe that there's no output):</p>
<pre><code>$ perl -ne &#39;chomp; @F=split/,/; print(@F) if scalar(@F) != 8&#39;  hh_demographic.csv
$ perl -ne &#39;chomp; @F=split/,/; print(@F) if scalar(@F) != 7&#39;  product.csv
$ perl -ne &#39;chomp; @F=split/,/; print(@F) if scalar(@F) != 12&#39; transaction_data.csv
$ perl -ne &#39;chomp; @F=split/,/; print(@F) if scalar(@F) != 5&#39;  causal_data.csv</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Make sure there's no pipe in any file (so we can use that as the delimitor in the next step):</p>
<pre><code>$ fgrep &#39;|&#39; *csv</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Extract relevant columns, skip headers, and deduplicate:</p>
<pre><code>$ tail -n+2 hh_demographic.csv   |
    awk -F&#39;,&#39; &#39;{print $8&quot;|&quot;$1&quot;|&quot;$2&quot;|&quot;$3&quot;|&quot;$4&quot;|&quot;$5&quot;|&quot;$6&quot;|&quot;$7}&#39;  \

<li><p><code>assign-store-state.pl</code> is a small Perl script that randomly assigns one of the three states to stores:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my @states = (&#39;CA&#39;, &#39;OR&#39;, &#39;WA&#39;);

while(&lt;&gt;) {
    chomp;
    my $state = $states[int(rand(3))];
    print(&quot;$_|$state\n&quot;);
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Load into tables:</p>
<pre><code>psql&gt; \copy household from household.psv     delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; \copy product from product.psv         delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; \copy store from store_state.psv       delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; \copy sells from sells.psv             delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; \copy transaction from transaction.psv delimiter &#39;|&#39;</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>transaction.psv has some <code>household_id</code>s that are not in the <code>household</code> table. To fix it:</p>
<pre><code>psql&gt; create temp table tmp_transaction as (select * from transaction limit 0);
psql&gt; \copy tmp_transaction from transaction.psv delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; insert into transaction (select * from tmp_transaction
        where household_id in (select household_id from household));</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This means we did not insert certain transactions. We have to circumvent this problem for subsequent files:</p>
<pre><code>psql&gt; create temp table tmp_transaction_product as (select * from includes limit 0);
psql&gt; \copy tmp_transaction_product from includes.psv delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; insert into includes (select * from tmp_transaction_product
        where transaction_id in (select transaction_id from transaction));

psql&gt; create temp table tmp_shops_at as (select * from shops_at limit 0);
psql&gt; \copy tmp_shops_at from shops_at.psv delimiter &#39;|&#39;
psql&gt; insert into shops_at (select * from tmp_shops_at
        where household_id in (select household_id from household));

psql&gt; drop table tmp_transaction;
psql&gt; drop table tmp_transaction_product;
psql&gt; drop table tmp_shops_at;

psql&gt; commit;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Many rows have been removed for this project because of the size of the dataset. For example before trimming, the <code>sells</code> table has 36,786,524 rows, which is quite unwieldy when joing with others.</p></li>

<li><p>Old question: Stores in which state sell the most charcoals.</p></li>
<li><p>Reason: Replaced the old one because it was similar to query #10 asking the families that buy the most 32 oz yogurt. The new query covers the 'trans_time' and 'week_no' attributes of transaction table which gives a better coverage of the schema.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>List information of families who have never bought anything from drug department(but have bought from other departments).</p>
